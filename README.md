# spiral-thing

This project is a spiral visualizer inspired by a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/perfectloops/comments/bzbgh4/i_cant_stop_watching/). I thought this would make a fun project, so I built a copy of this visualization with added controls. Using this tool, you are able to change the speed of the spiral, add or remove points, and play through the visualization frame by frame. I hope you enjoy it!
